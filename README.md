A federated multi-agent system is a multi-agent
system wherein agents collaborate with a central server to
optimize system goals without sharing their private information.
We develop a communication-efficient solution to resource
allocation problems for a population of agents coupled through
multiple indivisible shared resources in a federated multi-
agent system. The agents demand resources in a probabilistic
way based on their local computation and preferences, and
the agents receive either one unit of a resource or do not
receive it. The agents are not required to share their cost
functions or derivatives of cost functions with other agents
or the central server. Optimal control of a population of
such agents, subject to capacity constraints, is widely found
in many application domains, such as smart energy systems,
intelligent transportation systems, and edge computing, to name
a few. We present convergence results using multi-time scale
stochastic approximation techniques and an example of electric
vehicle charging point allocation illustrating the efficacy of the
developed solution.
